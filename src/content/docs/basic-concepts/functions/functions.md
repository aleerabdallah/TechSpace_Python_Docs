## What is a function?



A function is a block of code that performs a specific task.


>The primary purpose is to allow for the decomposition of a large and/or complicated problem into chunks that have relatively low cognitive load and to assign the chunks meaningful names (unless they are anonymous).  Wikepedia


## Things to Know about functions


1. Functions run when called 
2. A function can return a result
3. Functions can take inputs, process them, and return an output




## Advantages of using functions


1. Helps in breaking down complex task into smaller manageable sub tasks
2. Makes our code reusable
3. Make our code Modular and maintainable


## Types of functions



1. Built-in functions:

   You've probably used some of Python built-in functions such as `print()`, `input()`
   Are pre-defined functions that are always made available to us needing no imports.

2. User-defined functions:

   These functions are custom functions defined by programmers







## Defining a function

---

Function definition is the process of specifying a step by step of performing a specific task.
That is reusable, maintainable 



```py
  def sayHello():
    return "Hello"
```
