## What are Membership Operators

These operators are used to check if a given value is a member of a sequence and returns `True` if it is else it returns `False`

## Membership Operators in Python

There are only two membership operators in Python

### `in` operator

`in` operator checks if the value is a member of a sequence, and then returns either `True` if it is a member of that given sequence else returns `False`

Here's some examples

In the following examples we'll be using interactive shell

```py title="Example"

  name = "Python"
  print("y" in name)
  # output: True
  # this expression will return True because y is a member in name

  # -------------------------------------------------------------
  print("Y" in name)
  # output: False
  # the statement below is returning False because 'y' and 'Y' do not have the same value

  # -------------------------------------------------------------
  print("z" in name)
  # output: False
  # this expression will return False because z is not a member in name





```

> **Warning:** When using membership operators with strings, know that `"y"` and `"Y"` do not have the same value, so trying to check if capital `"Y"` is in `name` where there is only small `"y"` will always return `False`
>
> **Note:** Also when cheking for the existence of sub-string within a sequence, the order matters

### `not in` operator

`not in` operator exactly does the opposite by checking if the value is not a member of a sequence, and then returns either `True` if it is not a member of that given sequence else returns `False`

Here's some examples

```py title="Example"

  greeting = "Hello, World"

  print("L" in greeting)
  # output: False
  # the statement below will return False

  # -------------------------------------------------------------

  print("l" in greeting)
  # output: True
  # this expression will return True because l is a member in greeting

  # -------------------------------------------------------------

  print("ello" in greeting)
  # output: True
  # the statment below will return True

  # ------------------------------------------------

  print("Ello" in greeting)
  # output: False
  # the statment below will return False

```
