## Defining a function

Steps to define a function:

1. Start with `def` keyword which introduces function definition

2. `def` keyword must be followed by a function name and the parenthesis containing parameters if the function would be expecting inputs.

3. The body of the function starts on the next line and must be indented

4. The first statement of the function body can optionally be a function's documentation string `docstring`


```py 
   def function_name():
       function body
```



## Example

Let's define a function that prints a message

```py 
  def my_function():
      print("Hello from my function")
```


After we have defined the function above, now it's time to call it 

```py
  # calling a function 
  my_function() # output: Hello from my function
```
