## What are Comparison Operators

Also know us relational operators, are those operators that are used to compare values for equality, inequality and so on.


### Equalality operator

The equality operator represented by `==` checks if two object are equals, then either returns `True` if the two objects(operands) are equal, else returns `False` when they are equal.

#### Example

```py 
  >>> 
  >>> # returns True because both values are of the same data type and value 
  >>> 15 == 15
  True 
  >>>
  >>> # returns False because both values do have the same value 
  >>> # though they are of the same data type
  >>> 20 == 15
  False 
  >>> 
  >>> # 
  >>> 15.0 == 15 
  False 
  >>>
```


### Inequality operator 

Inequality operator represented by `!=` checks whether two objects(operands) are not equal, then it returns `True` if they are equal, else it returns `False`.


#### Example

```py 
  >>>
  >>> # returns False because both values are equal  
  >>> 10 != 10
  False 
  >>>
  >>> # returns True because both values are not of the same data type
  >>> 10 != 10.0 
  True 
  >>>
  >>> 
```


### Greater than 

Greater than operator symbolised by `>` compares if the left operand(value) is greater than the right operand(value). Returns True if greater than and False if not


#### Example

```py 
  >>>
  >>> # returns False
  >>> 68 > 86
  False 
  >>>
  >>> # returns True 
  >>> 20 > 10
  True
  >>>
  >>> # returns True 
  >>> -20 < 1
  True 
  >>> 
```


### Less than 

Less than operator represented by `<` compares if the left operand(value) is less than the right operand(value). Returns True if less than and False if not

#### Example

```py 
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> 30 < 60 
  True 
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> 19.1 < 10.9
  False
  >>>
  
```



### Greater than or equal 

Greater than or equal operator checks if the operand(value) on the left side is greater than or equals to the operand(value) on the right side.


#### Example

```py 
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> 12 >= 11
  True
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> 16.9 >= 17.7
  False 
  >>> 
```



### Less than or equal

Less than or equal operator symbolised by `<=` checks if the operand(value) on the left side is less than or equals to the operand(value) on the right side.


#### Example

```py 
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> 12 <= 29
  True
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> 20.3 <= 10.9
  False
  >>> 
```
