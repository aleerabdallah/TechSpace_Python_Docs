## What are Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are symbols that performs mathematical operations

There are seven arithmetic operators in Python

Here is an overview of arithmetic operators 


| Operator | Description        | Example           |
|:---      |      :---:         |               ---:|
| `+`      |  Addition          |  x + y = 30       | 
| `-`      |  Substraction      |  x - y = 10       | 
| `-`      |  Multiplication    |  x * y = 200       |
| `-`      |  Division          |  x / y = 10.0       |
| `-`      |  Floor Division    |  x // y = 10       |
| `-`      |  Exponent          |  x ** y =        |
| `%`      |  Modulus           |  x % y =        |

### Addition Operator

Addition operator symbolised by `+` is used to add two operands objects and returns their result.


#### Example 

```py 

```


### Subtraction Operator

Subtraction operator symbolised by `-` is used to subtract two operands or objects

#### Example 

```py 

```

### Multiplication Operator

#### Example 

```py 

```

### Division Operator


### Floor Division Operator

#### Example 

```py 

```


### Exponentiation Operator

#### Example 

```py 

```


### Modulus Operator

#### Example 

```py 

```
