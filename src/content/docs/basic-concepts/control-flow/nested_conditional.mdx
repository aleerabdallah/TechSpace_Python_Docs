In Python, a nested conditional is when one `if` statement is placed inside another `if` statement. This allows for more complex decision-making processes, where a condition is only checked if a previous condition was satisfied. Nested conditionals can be powerful but should be used with caution, as they can make the code harder to read and maintain.

### Syntax:

```py title="Syntax of Nested Conditional"
if condition1:
    if condition2:
        # Block of code if both condition1 and condition2 are True
    else:
        # Block of code if condition1 is True but condition2 is False
else:
    # Block of code if condition1 is False
```

#### How It Works:

- condition1 is evaluated first.
- If condition1 is True, the program enters the inner block and evaluates condition2.
- If condition2 is also True, the corresponding code is executed.
- If condition1 is False, the program skips the entire block of code and moves to the else block (if present).

### Example 1: Voting Eligibility and Age Restriction

Let’s take an example where we check if a person is eligible to vote, and if they are eligible, we check if they are old enough to drink alcohol.

```py title="Voting Eligibility and Age Restriction"
age = 20

if age >= 18:
    print("You are eligible to vote.")
    if age >= 21:
        print("You are also old enough to drink alcohol.")
    else:
        print("But you are not old enough to drink alcohol.")
else:
    print("You are too young to vote.")
```

#### Explanation:

- The outer if checks if the person is 18 or older.
- If age >= 18 is True, the program enters the nested if block and checks if the person is oldenough to drink.
- If the person is 21 or older, the message about drinking alcohol is printed; otherwise, the else statement within the nested block handles the case where they can't drink alcohol.

### Example 2: Number Category

In this example, we will check if a number is `positive`, `negative`, or `zero`, and if it’s positive, we'll further categorize it as `small` or `large`.

```py title="Number Category"
number = 50

if number > 0:
    print("The number is positive.")
    if number < 100:
        print("It’s a small number.")
    else:
        print("It’s a large number.")
elif number == 0:
    print("The number is zero.")
else:
    print("The number is negative.")
```

#### Explanation:

- The outer if checks if the number is positive.
- If it is positive, we then check whether it’s smaller than 100 or larger.
- If the number isn’t positive, we use an elif to check if it is zero, and the else block handles the case where the number is negative.

### Exercise: Nested Conditional Statements

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
       Write a program that takes the temperature as input and does the following:

        - If the temperature is below 0, print "It’s freezing."
        - If the temperature is above 0, check if it’s above 30:
          - If it’s above 30, print "It’s hot."
          - Otherwise, print "It’s a mild day."
    </li>

    <li>
       Write a program that calculates the discount based on the total purchase:

        - If the purchase amount is greater than $100, apply a 10% discount.
        - If the purchase amount is greater than $200, apply an additional 5% discount (making it 15% total).
        - If the purchase is less than $100, no discount is applied.
    </li>
