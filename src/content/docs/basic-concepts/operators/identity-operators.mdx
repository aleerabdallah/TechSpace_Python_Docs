## What are Identity Operators 

Python Identity operators are used to check if two objects have the same identity or if they refer to the same memory location


## Identity Operators in Python

There are two Identity Operators in Python

### `is` operator

`is` Identity operator checks if two objects refers to the same memory location, then returns `True` if they do refer to same memory location else returns `False`

#### Example: using `is` operator

```py 
  >>> a = 10 
  >>> b = a 
  >>>
  >>> c = 1200 
  >>>
  >>> # the statement below will return True
  >>> a is b 
  True 
  >>>
  >>> # the statement below will return False 
  >>> a is c 
  False

```

### `is not` operator

`is not` Identity operator exactly does the opposite by checking if two objects do not refer to the same memory location, then returns `True` if they do not refer to same memory location else returns `False`

#### Example: using `is not` operator

```py 
  >>> x = 20
  >>> y = x
  >>>
  >>> z = 12
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> x is y 
  True 
  >>> 
  >>> # 
  >>> y is z 
  False
```
