## Accessing a Subset of Strings

You can access characters in in a string using their index or a subset of characters through slicing.

### Accessing individual characters in a string 

You can access individual characters in a string by through their index.

```py title="example of accessing a character in a string"
  
  name = "Python"
  
  # prints a character at index or position 0
  print(name[0]) # outputs: P 
  
  # prints a character at index 5
  print(name[5]) # outputs: n

```


### Accessing a subset of characters in a string

You can access a subset of characters through slicing.

```py title="example of accessing substring"
  country = "Netherland"

  # print the last four characters
  print(country[6:]) # output: land

  # print the first 6 characters 
  print(country[0:5]) # outputs: Nether
```
