## What are Membership Operators

These operators are used to check if a given value is a member of a sequence and returns `True` if it is else it returns `False`



## Membership Operators in Python

There are only two membership operators in Python

### `in` operator 

`in` operator checks if the value is a member of a sequence, and then returns either `True` if it is a member of that given sequence else returns `False`

Here's some examples

In the following examples we'll be using interactive shell

#### Example 

```py 
  
  >>> name = "Python"
  >>>
  >>> # this expression will return True because y is a member in name
  >>> "y" in name 
  True
  >>> 
  >>> # the statement below is returning False because 'y' and 'Y' do not have the same value
  >>> "Y" in name 
  False
  >>> 
  >>> # this expression will return False because z is not a member in name
  >>> "z" in name
  False 
  >>> 
  



```

	

>
> **Warning:** When using membership operators with strings, know that `"y"` and `"Y"` do not have the same value, so trying to check if capital `"Y"` is in `name` where there is only small `"y"` will always return `False`
>
> **Note:** Also when cheking for the existence of sub-string within a sequence, the order matters
>





### `not in` operator

`not in` operator exactly does the opposite by checking if the value is not a member of a sequence, and then returns either `True` if it is not a member of that given sequence else returns `False`

Here's some examples

#### Example 

```py
  
  >>> greeting = "Hello, World"
  >>> 
  >>> # the statement below will return False
  >>> "L" in greeting
  False 
  >>> 
  >>> # the statement below will return True 
  >>> "l" in greeting 
  True 
  >>>
  >>> # the statment below will return True
  >>> "ello" in greeting
  True 
  >>> 
  >>> # the statment below will return False
  >>> "Ello" in greeting 
  False 
  >>>



```
