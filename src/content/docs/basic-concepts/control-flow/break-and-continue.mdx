## `break` statement

The break statement is used to exit a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met.

### Examples:


```py
# Using break to exit the loop when a condition is met
for number in range(1, 10):
    if number == 5:
        break  # Exit the loop when number is 5
    print(number)  # This will print numbers 1 to 4

```



## `continue` statement

The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration.


### Examples:

Here are some examples using continue statements

```py 
# Using continue to skip even numbers
for number in range(1, 10):
    if number % 2 == 0:
        continue  # Skip even numbers
    print(number)  # This will print only odd numbers

```
