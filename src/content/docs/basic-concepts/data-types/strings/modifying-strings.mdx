## Strings: Immutable data type 

Strings are immutable data type, meaning any attemp of modifying a string after it's has been created will returns a new string.


## String concatenation 

A string can not be modified after it has been created so string concatenation might seem like modifying a string but it's not, for when you concatenate two strings you get back a new string.

```py title="example of string concatenation"
  
  greeting = "Hello"
  
  #concatenate Hello with World
  greeting += " World"

  print(greeting) #outputs: Hello World
```
