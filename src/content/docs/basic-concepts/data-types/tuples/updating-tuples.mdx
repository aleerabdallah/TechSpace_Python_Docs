## Updating a tuple

Tuple is an immutable data type, it's a state can not be changed after creation. After constructing a tuple you can't add into or remove an element from it.

### Example 

```py title="updating a tuple"
  countries = ("England", "India", "China")
  
  # trying to update England with Argentina
  countries[0] = "Argentina"

  # Output: TypeError: tuple object does not support item assignment
```
