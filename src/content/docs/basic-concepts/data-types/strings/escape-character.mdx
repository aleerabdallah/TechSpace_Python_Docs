## String: Escape characters

Escape characters are a set of characters that help you include special characters in strings.

### single quotes or double quotes 

```py title="example to include single or double quote"
  
  # this will raise a syntax error
  message = 'Hy, how are you 'doing''

  # to include '' quote around doing 
  message = 'Hy, how are you \'doing\''

  print(message) # outputs: "Hy, how are you 'doing' "

```

### including tab or newline 

```py title="example of including a tab or newline"
  
  string1 = "Hello\tWorld!"
  
  # prints Hello with four spaces to the right before World
  print(string1) # outputs: Hello    World!

  respond = "I'm good \nHow about you"
  print(respond) 
```

These are few examples of escape characters in Python.
