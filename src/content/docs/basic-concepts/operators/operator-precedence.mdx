## What is Operator Precendence

Operator precendence is the order on which operators are evaluated. Python follow a specific rule when multiple operators are present in expression, to determine which operator to apply first.

Operator Precedence Levels

Here is a list of common operators in Python, ordered from highest to lowest precedence:

| Highest | Operator                                                                    |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|         | Parentheses ()                                                              |
|         | Exponentiation: **                                                          |
|         | Unary Plus and Minus:  -X, -X                                               |
|         | Multiplication, Division, Floor Division, and Modulus: *, /, //, %          |
|         | Addition and Subtraction:  +, -                                             |
|         | Bitwise Shift Operators:  &lt;&lt;, &gt;&gt;                                |
|         | Bitwise AND: &                                                              |
|         | Bitwise XOR: ^                                                              |
|         | Bitwise OR:  |                                                              |
|         | Comparison Operators:  ==, !=, &gt;, &lt;, &lt;=, &gt;=                     |
|         | Identity Operators: is, is not                                              |
|         | Membership Operators: in, not in                                            |
|         | Logical NOT: not                                                            |
|         | Logical AND: and                                                            |
|  Lowest | Logical OR: or                                                              |
