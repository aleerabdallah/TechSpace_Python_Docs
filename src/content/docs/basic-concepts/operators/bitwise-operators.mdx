## What are Bitwise Operators

Bitwise operators are used to perform operations on binary numbers.

Here's the following betwise operators


### Bitwise and operator `&`
Does a "bitwise and". Each bit of the output is 1 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 1, otherwise it's 0.


### Betwise or operator `|`
Does a "bitwise or". Each bit of the output is 0 if the corresponding bit of x AND of y is 0, otherwise it's 1.

### Betwise complement operator `~`
 Returns the complement of x - the number you get by switching each 1 for a 0 and each 0 for a 1. This is the same as -x - 1.


### Betwise exlcusive or `^`
Does a "bitwise exclusive or". Each bit of the output is the same as the corresponding bit in x if that bit in y is 0, and it's the complement of the bit in x if that bit in y is 1.



### Bitwise shift operators: `<<` and `>>`

#### left betwise shift `<<` 
x `<<` y
Returns x with the bits shifted to the left by y places (and new bits on the right-hand-side are zeros). This is the same as multiplying x by 2**y.

#### right betwise shift `>>`
x `>>` y
Returns x with the bits shifted to the right by y places. This is the same as //'ing x by 2**y.
