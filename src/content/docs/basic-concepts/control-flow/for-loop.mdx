The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (like a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). It iterates over items in the order they appear in the sequence. 

<Aside title="note" type="note">
  The loop variable takes on each of the values in the sequence

## `for` loop Syntax:

```py 

for item in sequence:
    print(item)



```

## Examples

Example:


```py
# using a for loop to iterate over a sequence of characters

characters = “Python”

for char in characters:
    print(char)

```


Example:

```py 
# Using a for loop to iterate over a list
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
for fruit in fruits:
    print(fruit)


```

## using built-in `range()` function

A built-in range function returns a sequence of numbers based on the given arguments

`range(start, stop, step)`

default:

**start**: defaults to `0`

**stop**: required `*`

**step**: defaults to `1`

```py 

for i in range(6):
    print(i)
  

```
