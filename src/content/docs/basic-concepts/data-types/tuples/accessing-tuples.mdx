## How to access the elements of a tuple

The items of a tuple can be accessed through using the index number inside a square bracket.


### Indexing 

#### Example

```py title="using indexs to access the elements"
  # Accessing an item at index 2 
  animals = ("dog", "panther", "tiger")

  print(animals[2]) # outputs: tiger
  print(animals[0]) # outputs: dog
  print(animals[1]) # outputs: panther

```


### Slicing

Sometimes you might want to access a subset of the items or elements in a tuple that's when slicing comes in handy.

#### Example 

```py title="using slicing to access a subset of elements"
  
  colors = ("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue")

  print(colors)  # outputs: ("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue")

  
  # returns a subset of colors starting from the color at index 2 (yellow)
  print(colors[2:]) 


```
