## Looping over elements in a tuple 

Tuple support looping through it's elements with `for loop` and also `while loop`. Let's see examples using both loops techniques.

### Using for loop


#### Example 

Looping through tuples using a for loop without index

```py title="looping over a tuple using for loop without index"
  
  for i in range(len(colors)):
      print(colors[i])
```

#### Example 

Looping through tuples using an index

```py title="using for loop with a tuple"
  
  for i in range(len(colors)):
      print(colors[i])
```

### Using while loop

To loop through the elements of a tuple using while loop, you use indexs to access or visit each element, so knowning the length of a tuple is necessary. You can using `len()` built-in function to get the exact length

#### Example 

```py title="using while loop with a tuple"
  
  i = 0 

  while i < len(tuple):
     print(tuple[i])
```
