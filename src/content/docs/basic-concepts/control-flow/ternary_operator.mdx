The **ternary operator** in Python is a shorthand way of writing an `if-else` statement in a single line. It is useful when you want to assign a value based on a condition, without writing a full `if-else` block. The ternary operator helps make code more concise and readable in simple cases.

### Syntax of the Ternary Operator

The basic syntax of the ternary operator in Python is:

```py title="Syntax of Ternary Operator"
value_if_true if condition else value_if_false
```

- condition: The condition that is being evaluated.
- value_if_true: The value that will be returned if the condition is True.
- value_if_false: The value that will be returned if the condition is False.

### Example 1: Simple Ternary Operation

Letâ€™s check if a number is even or odd using the ternary operator:

```py title="Simple Ternary Operation"
number = 10

result = "Even" if number % 2 == 0 else "Odd"
print(result)
```

#### Explanation:

- The condition number % 2 == 0 checks if the number is even.
- If the condition is True, "Even" is assigned to the variable result; otherwise, "Odd" is assigned.

### Example 2: Assigning Values Based on Condition

You can also use the ternary operator to assign values to variables:

```py title="Assigning Values Based on Condition"
age = 20

status = "Adult" if age >= 18 else "Minor"
print(status)
```

### When to Use the Ternary Operator

The ternary operator is best used for simple conditions where you can express the logic clearly in one line. For more complex conditions, stick with regular if-else statements for readability.
