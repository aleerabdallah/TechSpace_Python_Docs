## Comments in Python 

Comments in Python or programming in general, are notes added to the source to explain what the code does, itâ€™s purpose and logic. They are ignored by the Python interpreter, because they are only meant to clarify the code.

## Types of comments:

1. Single-line comments
2. Multi-line comments

## Single-line comment 

Single line comments in python starts with a hash symbol (#) and continue until the end of the line

### Example of a single-line comment

```py 

  # this function will output: Hello, World
  print("Hello, World")

  # this function will be ignored because everything after `#` is a comment
  #print("Welcome to")

```


## Multi-line comment

Multi-line comments are comments that span to multiple lines 

Python doesn't support multi-line comments out of the box so the recommended way is to use multiple `#` to write multi-line comments

### Example of a multi-line comment

```py 
  #


  def function_name():
      pass
```


## Documentation String

Documentation string in Python are used to clarify the functionality, usage, and purpose of a module, class, or function, helping other developers to easily understand your code without the need of reading through all the details of the implementation.

Docstrings are written using either triple single quotes `'''` or triple double quotes `"""`
and they should be the first statement after the definition of the entity they document.





### Accessing Documentation String

Sometimes you might want to know what a particular function does, especially some built-in functions so it easier to access their docstring using the following syntax:

#### Example: using `__doc__` attribute 

```py 
  print(sum.__doc__)
```

#### Example: using `help()` built-in function

```py 
  print(help(sum))
```


### Example:

In this example, we are a documenting a function called `display_info`

```py 
  
  def display_info(name, age):
      """Display's person's information

      :arguments:
          :name str, name should be a string 
          :age
      """
      print(f"Name: {name}")
      print(f"Age: {age}")
```
