## What are Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are symbols that performs mathematical operations

There are seven arithmetic operators in Python

Here is an overview of arithmetic operators 


| Operator | Description        | Example           |
|:---      |      :---:         |               ---:|
| `+`      |  Addition          |      x + y = 30       | 
| `-`      |  Substraction      |      x - y = 10       | 
| `-`      |  Multiplication    |      x * y = 200       |
| `-`      |  Division          |      x / y = 2.0       |
| `-`      |  Floor Division    |      x // y = 2       |
| `-`      |  Exponent          |      x ** y = 4 # if x = 2, y = 2      |
| `%`      |  Modulus           |      x % y =  0      |

### Addition Operator

Addition operator represented by `+` adds the object(value) on its left with object(value) on its right and then returns the result 

#### Example 

```py title="example of addition operator"
  >>>
  >>> #
  >>> 5 + 9
  14
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```


### Subtraction Operator

Substraction operator symbolised by `-` subtracts the value on its right from the value on its left and then returns the result.


#### Example 

```py title="example of subtraction operator"
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> 11 - 9
  2
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```



### Multiplication Operator

Multiplication operator represented by `*` multiplies the operand(value) on its left by the value or object on its right, and returns the result.


#### Example 

```py title="example of multiplication operator"
  >>>
  >>> 10 * 5
  50
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```


### Division Operator

Division operator represented by `/` divides the value or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then returns the result.


#### Example 

```py title="example of division operator"
  >>>
  >>>
  >>> 30 / 3
  10.0
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```



### Floor Division Operator

Floor Division operator represented by `//` divides the value or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then returns the result by discarding the floating points.

#### Example 

```py title="example of floor division operator"
  >>>
  >>> 30 // 3
  10
  >>>
  >>> 10 // 3
  3
  >>>
  >>>
```


### Exponentiation Operator



#### Example 

```py title="example of exponentiation operator"
  >>>
  >>> 5 ** 2
  25
  >>>
  >>> 2 * 5
  32
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```


### Modulus Operator

Modulus operator represented by `%` divides the value or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then returns the remainder.

#### Example 

```py title="example of modulus operator"
  >>>
  >>> 20 % 10
  0
  >>>
  >>> 10 % 3
  1
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```
