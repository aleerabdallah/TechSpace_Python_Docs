## What are Assignment Operators

Generally in programming, assignment operators are those operators(symbols) that are used to assign a value to a variable. 





## Basic Assignment operator

Basic assignment operator represented by `=` assigns the value on the its right to a variable on its left

### Example

```py 
  >>> 
  >>> #
  >>> x = 10
  >>>
  >>> #
  >>> x 
  10
  >>> 
  >>> # 
  >>> x = 20 
  >>> 
  >>> x 
  20
  >>> 
```


## Addition Assignment operator

Addition assignment operator symbolised by `+=` adds the operand(value) on its right to the variable or property on its left, and assigns the result to the variable or property on its left.

### Example

```py 
  >>> 
  >>> # 
  >>> x = 18
  >>>
  >>> #
  >>> x += 2 
  20
  >>>
```

## Subtraction Assignment operator

Subtraction assignment operator symbolised by `-=` subtracts the operand(value) on its right from the variable or property on its left, and assigns the result to the variable or property on its left.

### Example

```py 
  >>> 
  >>> # 
  >>> x = 20
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> x -= 10 
  10
  >>>
```

## Multiplication Assignment operator

Multiplication assignment operator symbolised by `*=` multiply the operand(value) on its right by the variable or property on its left, and assigns the result to the variable or property on its left.

### Example

```py 
  >>> 
  >>> #
  >>> x = 10
  >>> 
  >>> #
  >>> x *= 2
  20
  >>>
```

## Division Assignment operator

Division assignment operator represented by `/=` divides the variable or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then assigns the result to the variable or object on its left

### Example

```py 
  >>> 
  >>> #
  >>> x = 10
  >>> 
  >>> x 
  10
  >>>
  >>>
  >>> x /= 2 
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> x
  5.0
  >>>
```

## Floor Division Assignment operator

Floor-Division assignment operator represented by `//=` divides the variable or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then assigns the result to the variable or object on its left

### Example

```py 
  >>> 
  >>> #
  >>> x = 10
  >>>
  >>> #
  >>> x 
  10
  >>> 
  >>> x //= 2
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> x 
  5
  >>> 
```

## Modulus Assignment operator

Division assignment operator represented by `%=` divides the variable or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then assigns the result to the variable or object on its left

### Example

```py 
  >>> 
  >>> # 
  >>> x = 9 
  >>>
  >>> x 
  9
  >>> 
  >>> # 
  >>> x %= 2
  >>>
  >>> x 
  1
  >>>
```
