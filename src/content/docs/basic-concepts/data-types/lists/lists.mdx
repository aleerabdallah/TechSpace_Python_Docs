## Python List

Lists are built-in data types that store a collection of ordered values. It's one of the most flexible, used python data type.

## Features that list have

1. **Mutable**:
Lists are mutable, it's elements can be modified after after the list has been created.


2. **Ordered**: 
The order in which the elements where added is maintained

3. **Heterogeneous**: 
A list can a contain different data types such as integers, floats, and other data types as well


## Creating a list 

A list in Python can be created in one of the following ways.

### Empty List

An empty list can be created using an empty square brackets `[]`.

#### Example

```py title="example of creating an empty list"
  
  my_list = []
```

### A list with values 

To create a list place a sequence of comma-separated values within a square bracket.

#### Example

```py title="example of creating a list with values in python"
  
  # a list whose elements are of string data type
  programming_lang = ["C#", "Golang", "Python", "JavaScript"]
  
  # a list containing a mixed data types
  mixed_list = ["Newton", 22]

```


### using the built-in `list()` function

#### Example 

```py title="creating a list using tuple()"
  
  # creating an empty list 
  empty_list = list() 
  
  mark_language = "HTML"

  # create a list containing a sequence of string characters
  chars = list(mark_language)

```
