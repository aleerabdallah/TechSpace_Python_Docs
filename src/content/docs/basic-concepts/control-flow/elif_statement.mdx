The elif statement `(short for "else if")` is used to check multiple conditions in sequence. It allows you to handle more than two possible outcomes in your control flow. If the first condition is `False`, the `elif` statement checks another condition, and if this condition is `True`, the associated block of code will run.

Using `elif` makes your code cleaner by avoiding excessive nesting of `if` statements.

### Syntax of elif

```py title="Syntax of elif"
if condition1:
    # Block of code to execute if condition1 is True
elif condition2:
    # Block of code to execute if condition1 is False but condition2 is True
```

You can have as many elif statements as needed, and you can also combine if, elif, and else to handle different situations.

### Example 1: Grading System

Let’s create a program that assigns a letter grade based on a student’s score:

```py title="Grading System"
score = 85

if score >= 90:
    print("You got an A!")
elif score >= 80:
    print("You got a B!")
elif score >= 70:
    print("You got a C!")
elif score >= 60:
    print("You got a D!")
else:
    print("You got an F!")
```

#### Explanation:

- If the score is greater than or equal to 90, the program prints "You got an A!" and stops checking further conditions.
- If the score is less than 90 but greater than or equal to 80, it prints "You got a B!" and stops.
- This process continues until the program finds a condition that is True, or defaults to the else block if none of the conditions match.

```py title="Output for score = 85"
You got a B!
```

```py title="Output for score = 72"
You got a C!
```

### Example 2: Categorizing Age Groups

Let's categorize people based on their age:

```py title="Categorizing Age Groups"
age = 45

if age < 13:
    print("You are a child.")
elif age < 20:
    print("You are a teenager.")
elif age < 65:
    print("You are an adult.")
else:
    print("You are a senior.")
```

```py title="Output for age = 45"
You are an adult.
```

### Complex Conditions with elif

You can use comparison and logical operators (and, or, not) in elif statements to check more complex conditions.

```py title="Complex Conditions with elif"
temperature = 32
is_raining = True

if temperature > 30 and is_raining:
    print("It's a hot and rainy day.")
elif temperature > 30 and not is_raining:
    print("It's a hot and dry day.")
elif temperature <= 30 and is_raining:
    print("It's a cool and rainy day.")
else:
    print("It's a cool and dry day.")
```

### Exercise: elif Statements

<Steps>
  <ol>
    <li>
       Write a program that asks the user for a number and then prints whether the number is:

        - Positive
        - Negative
        - Zero
    </li>

    <li>
       Create a program that asks for a person's age and prints which type of movies they are allowed to watch:

        - Under 13: "G-rated"
        - 13 to 17: "PG-13"
        - 18 and above: "R-rated"
    </li>
