## Accessing a Dictionary

Data or values in a dictionary can be accessed through their corresponding keys.


```py title="example of accessing values in a dictionary"
  
  info = {
    "name": "Kevin",
    "age": 11,
  }

  # prints any data associated with the following key
  print(info["name"])

  # prints a value associated with the following key
  print(info["age"])
```


### using `get()` method 

`get()` method returns a value corresponding to the given key if the key exists, it doesn't raised any error if the key doesn't exists. 

```py title="example of using get()"
  

  laptop = {
    "model": "HP 360 probook",
    "price": 250.9
  }

  # prints the value associated with model key 
  print(laptop.get("model"))

  # prints the value associated with price key 
  print(laptop.get("price"))

  # this will raise a KeyError
  print(laptop["ram"])

  # returns nothing without raising any error
  print(laptop.get("ram"))


```
