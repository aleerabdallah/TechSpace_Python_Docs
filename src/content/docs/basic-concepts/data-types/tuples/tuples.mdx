## Tuple Data Type

Tuple is a built-in immutable data type that is used to store a collection of data. It can be of the same or different data type. It's best suitable for storing a data that cannot change since it's immutable, unlike a list whose elements can be modified.


## Creating a tuple 


A tuple data type can be created using a comma separated-values placed within a parenthesis ().



#### Example:

```py title="creating a tuple"
  # creating a tuple with different data type

  student_info = (“Ben”, 21, 8500.0)

  # Incorrect way of creating a tuple with one item
  number = (2)

  # Correct way of creating a tuple with one item 
  price = (23,)



```


**Note**

> When creating a tuple with one item, we put a comma after that item.

## Other ways of creating a tuple 

There are other ways of creating a tuple which we'll mention.

### using `tuple()` constructor

One of the built-in `tuple()` function is also used to create a tuple. It takes a sequence data type and constructs a tuple with it's items. If no argument is provided then it will construct an empty tuple.

#### Example 

```py title="using tuple() to create a tuple"
  colors = ["red", "orange", "yellow"]
  
  tuple_colors = tuple(colors)
  
```
