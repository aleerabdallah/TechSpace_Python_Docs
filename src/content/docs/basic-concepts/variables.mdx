## What is a variable?

In programming a variable is often referred to as named storage location that stores a data or value.
The data or value stored in a variable may change through out the program execution.


## Variables data type

A variable data type is a refers to the type of value or data a variable is storing.

Variables data type in python are derived from the value they store, because Python is a dynamically-typed, meaning the variable data type is subject to change with respect to change of its value type.


## Constants 

A constant is a value or data which can be used but can't be modified during the program execution. It stores a fixed value unlike a variable whose value can be changed.

It's value is meant to not be modified once assigned.

### Defining a constant 

When defining a constant, all the characters of the constant name should be in upper case.

```py 
  PI =  3.14 
  MONTHS = 12
```

## Variable - Naming conventions:

Variable naming conventions are a set of guidelines that helps in choosing a descriptive and meaningful names for variables. Which helps make the code more readable and maintainable if consistently adhered to.

+ variable name should be descriptive and meaningful

+ Do not use abriviations unless widely used (e.g., URL)

+ Use lowercase letters, underscores, and numbers (e.g., my_variable)

+ Avoid using special characters like $ and _ as the first character


+ if a variable name contains more than one word then join them using use underscore _ (e.g., my_seond_variable)

+ Constants are written in all uppercase (e.g., PI)

#### Example 

```py 
  

  # acceptable variable name 
  department = "Computer Science"

  # not acceptable SyntaxError: invalid decimal literal
  3department = " " 


```


Things to know:

1. A variable maybe referenced by several different identifiers.

2. Assigning a value to a variable using one of identifiers will change the value that can be accessed through other identifiers.




## Scope of a variable

Scope of variable determines its accessibility within a program, in simple terms, it determines from where within your code you can use a variable.

### Global-variable 

Global variables have a global scope therefore they are accessible everywhere within your code. 


### Local-variable

Local variables have a local scope therefore they are only accessible within a function or block scope.
