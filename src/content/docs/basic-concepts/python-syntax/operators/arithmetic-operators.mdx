## What are Arithmetic Operators

Arithmetic operators are symbols that performs mathematical operations

There are seven arithmetic operators in Python

Here is an overview of arithmetic operators 


| Operator | Description        | Example           |
|:---      |      :---:         |               ---:|
| `+`      |  Addition          |  x + y = 30       | 
| `-`      |  Substraction      |  x - y = 10       | 
| `-`      |  Multiplication    |  x * y = 200       |
| `-`      |  Division          |  x / y = 10.0       |
| `-`      |  Floor Division    |  x // y = 10       |
| `-`      |  Exponent          |  x ** y =        |
| `%`      |  Modulus           |  x % y =        |

### Addition Operator

Addition operator represented by `+` adds the object(value) on its left with object(value) on its right and then returns the result 

#### Example 

```py 
  >>>
  >>> #
  >>> 5 + 9
  14
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```


### Subtraction Operator

Substraction operator symbolised by `-` subtracts the value on its right from the value on its left and then returns the result.


#### Example 

```py 
  >>>
  >>> # 
  >>> 11 - 9
  2
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```



### Multiplication Operator

Multiplication operator represented by `*` multiplies the operand(value) on its left by the value or object on its right, and returns the result.


#### Example 

```py 
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```


### Division Operator

Division operator represented by `/` divides the value or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then returns the result.


#### Example 

```py 
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```



### Floor Division Operator

Floor Division operator represented by `//` divides the value or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then returns the result by discarding the floating points.

#### Example 

```py 
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```


### Exponentiation Operator



#### Example 

```py 
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```


### Modulus Operator

Modulus operator represented by `%` divides the value or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then returns the remainder.

#### Example 

```py 
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
  >>>
```
