Here I'll put some introduction to File



## Opening a File:


The first thing to do when working with files is to open a file, which something you normally do when you want to read the content of a file.

Python has a `open()` function built into 
You can open a file using the `open()` function. The syntax is:

Open file and return a corresponding file object. If the file cannot be opened, an `OSError` is raised


## syntax:

```py 
open(file)

```

file is a path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the current working directory) of the file to be opened.

### Example

```py 

file = open("names.txt")

```

>  If the file is not found, 
>  `FileNotFoundError:` exception is raised with - No such file or directory: 'welcome.txt' message

## Closing a file

You hould always close a file after opening it, either for read, write or modification.
