## What are Identity Operators

Python Identity operators are used to check if two objects have the same identity or if they refer to the same memory location

## Identity Operators in Python

There are two Identity Operators in Python

### `is` operator

`is` Identity operator checks if two objects refers to the same memory location, then returns `True` if they do refer to same memory location else returns `False`

#### Example: using `is` operator

```py
   a = 10
   b = a

   c = 1200

   print(a is b)
   # the statement below will return True
   # output: True

   print(a is c)
   # the statement below will return False
   # output: False

```

### `is not` operator

`is not` Identity operator exactly does the opposite by checking if two objects do not refer to the same memory location, then returns `True` if they do not refer to same memory location else returns `False`

#### Example: using `is not` operator

```py
   x = 20
   y = x

   z = 12

   print(x is y)
   # the statement below will return True
   # output: True

   print(x is not z)
   # the statement below will return False because x and y is z
   # output: False
```
