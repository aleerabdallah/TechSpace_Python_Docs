## Python Syntax

Syntax refers to a set of rules that governs the structure of a programming language.

## First Python Program

Let's write our first Python program, that prints "Hello, World" to the console.
We'll cover how to run Python in two different modes.



### Interactive mode 


#### Introduction to Python Interactive Shell

The Python interactive shell, also known as the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), allows you to execute Python code in real-time.
It is a very powerful way to test out new ideas or inspect modules and packages (remember help(x)).

Here's the step to follow before using Python interactive shell:

**1. Open a Terminal or CMD**

- On Windows, you can search for `cmd` and `powershell`

- On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal application.

**2. Start Python:**

You should see a prompt that looks like this:

```py
Python 3.x.x (default, ... ) 
[GCC ...] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>

```

#### Using the interactive shell



```py
Python 3.x.x (default, ... ) 
[GCC ...] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>>
>>>"Hello, World"
Hello, World
>>> 
>>>

```

Now you have written your first Python program.

To exit Python, you can enter `exit()`, `quit()`, or select `Ctrl-Z`.


### Script mode

Python is usually run in script mode. This is a common way to run Python programs, especially for larger projects or when you want to execute a series of commands at once.

#### Steps to run Python in script mode 

**1. Create Python script:**

  
    - Use a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write your Python code.
    - Save the file with a .py extension. For example, you might create a file named script.py.

**2. Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**

    - On Windows, you can use Command Prompt or PowerShell.
    - On macOS or Linux, open the Terminal application.

**3. Navigate to the Directory:**

    - Use the cd command to change to the directory where your Python script is located. For example:

    ```sh 
      cd path/to/your/script
    ```

**4. Run the Script:**

    - Use the python or python3 command followed by the name of your script to run it. 
    For example:

    ```sh 
      python greeting.py
    ```

    or 

    ```sh 
      python3 greeting.py
    ```

    The output of the script will be displayed in the terminal. For the example above, you would see:

    ```
      Hello, Alice!
    ```
## Indentation


Python uses whitespace indentation, rather than curly brackets `{}` to define the scope of blocks of code. Indentation in Python can be used to group related statements together. Curly braces can be used to create functions, control statements, and classes.



**In simple Term**
> 
> It's a space added at the beginning of a code line. 
> Identifying a block of code
>
> The recommended indent size is four spaces.

## Comments

Comments are ignored by the Python interpreter, meaning they do not affect the execution of the program.
Everything after hash `#` character is ignored by the interpreter

```py title="Example to comments"
  
  # This is comment
  x = 10
  print(x) # output: 10
```
