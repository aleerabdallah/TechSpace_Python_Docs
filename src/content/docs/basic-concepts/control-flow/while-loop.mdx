The while loop continues to execute as long as a specified condition is True.

<Aside title="note" type="note">
  In most computer programming languages, a while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition. The while loop can be thought of as a repeating if statement. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/While_loop

## `while` loop Syntax:

```py 

  while expression:
      # statement to be executed if the expression evaluates to true

```
