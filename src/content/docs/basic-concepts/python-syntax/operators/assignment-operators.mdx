## What are Assignment Operators

Generally in programming, assignment operators are those operators(symbols) that are used to assign a value to a variable.

### Basic Assignment operator

Basic assignment operator represented by `=` assigns the value on the its right to a variable on its left

```py title="Example"
  x = 10
  print(x)
  # output: 10
  # -------------------------------------------------------------
  y = 20
  print(y)
  # output: 20

```

### Addition Assignment operator

Addition assignment operator symbolised by `+=` adds the operand(value) on its right to the variable or property on its left, and assigns the result to the variable or property on its left.

```py title="Example"
   x = 18
   x += 10
   print(x)
   # output: 28
   # -------------------------------------------------------------
   y = 40
   y += 15
   print(y)
   # output: 55

```

### Subtraction Assignment operator

Subtraction assignment operator symbolised by `-=` subtracts the operand(value) on its right from the variable or property on its left, and assigns the result to the variable or property on its left.

```py title="Example"
  x = 23
  x -= 10
  print(x)
  # output: 13
  # -------------------------------------------------------------
  y = 50
  y -= 15
  print(y)
  # output: 35
```

### Multiplication Assignment operator

Multiplication assignment operator symbolised by `*=` multiply the operand(value) on its right by the variable or property on its left, and assigns the result to the variable or property on its left.

```py title="Example"
  x = 18
  x *= 30
  print(x)
  # output: 540
  # -------------------------------------------------------------
  y = 40
  y *= 15
  print(y)
  # output: 600
```

### Division Assignment operator

Division assignment operator represented by `/=` divides the variable or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then assigns the result to the variable or object on its left

```py title="Example"
  x = 10
  x /= 2
  print(x)
  # output: 5
  # -------------------------------------------------------------
  y = 11
  y /= 4
  print(y)
  # output: 2.75
```

### Floor Division Assignment operator

Floor-Division assignment operator represented by `//=` divides the variable or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then assigns the result to the variable or object on its left

```py title="Example"
  x = 10
  x //= 2
  print(x)
  # output: 5
  # -------------------------------------------------------------
  y = 11
  y //= 4
  print(y)
  # output: 2
```

### Modulus Assignment operator

Division assignment operator represented by `%=` divides the variable or object on the its left by the operand(value) on its right, and then assigns the result to the variable or object on its left

```py title="Example"
  x = 10
  x %= 2
  print(x)
  # output: 0
  # -------------------------------------------------------------
  y = 11
  y %= 4
  print(y)
  # output: 3
```
